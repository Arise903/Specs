  "description": "**What is BridgeKit?**\n\nBridgeKit is a lightweight Swift library designed to simplify communication between your native iOS app and JavaScript code running within a `WKWebView`. It provides a clean and intuitive API for sending and receiving messages, enabling seamless interaction between your native and web content.\n\n**Why use BridgeKit?**\n\n*   **Simplified Message Handling:** BridgeKit abstracts away the complexities of `WKWebView` communication, providing a streamlined approach to sending and receiving messages.\n*   **Flexible Data Exchange:** Send and receive complex data structures (using `Codable` objects) between your app and the webview.\n*   **Improved Maintainability:** Separate message handling logic from your view code for better organization and easier maintenance.",
